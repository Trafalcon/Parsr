# Amazon Textract Input Module

To use the Amazon Textract input module, you need a valid set of access keys from AWS with "*AmazonTextractFullAccess*"
You can generate one for free following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

Once you have the key, make sure to set the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<ACCESS_KEY>` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET_KEY>` before running Parsr.

If you are using Amazon Textract with Parsr GUI, input fields for the **access key ID** and **secret access key** will be available and required.
